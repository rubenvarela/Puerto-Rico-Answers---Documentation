# Oakland Answers: Content Style Guide

Oakland Answers is for everyone in Oakland. It has a welcoming and reassuring tone and aims to be a trusted and familiar resource. Many of our guidelines borrow from Gov.uk's valuable Content Style Principles, but this style guide is unique to Oakland Answers, catering both to its focus on answering questions conversationally as if speaking to a neighbor, yet also maintaining readability of the content.


## Tone of Voice

### Address the User

Users benefit from simple, direct language. Address the user as “you” where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action.

E.g.:

> - “You can contact the Oaklanders Assistance Center by phone or email”
-  “Pay your parking ticket”

Don’t use “we,” “I,” “our,” “us.”

###Use Plain English

Use plain English – don’t use complicated or long words when easy or short ones will do. 

E.g.:

 - Use “buy” instead of “purchase”
 - Use “help” instead of “assist”
 - Use “about” instead of “approximately”
 - Use “like” instead of “such as”
 
Write content as simply as possible so that it is usable and accessible to everyone in Oakland, regardless of their language and vocabulary skills.

Write conversationally – picture your audience and write as if you were talking to them one-to-one but with the authority of someone who can actively assist.

***Please note: use of plain English is mandatory for all sections of the site – all audiences should understand our content; this isn’t “dumbing down,” this is opening up government information to all.***

### Avoid Jargon

Avoid unnecessary jargon, legalistic prose, unexplained abbreviations or acronyms, rarely used Latin terms (“inter alia,” “ad hoc”), etc.

Sometimes it might be impossible to avoid unusual words or phrases – but these must be explained where possible.

When referencing a form, always give the English title of the form. 

E.g.:

 > “Application for Registration.”

Also, if there is a copy of the form online, link to it.

### Use an Active and Positive Voice

Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, engaging content.

When possible, word sentences as positives. 

E.g.:

  Instead of, “No credit cards accepted” (both negative and passive voice)  
  Write, “Pay with personal check or cash”
  
### Use Gender Neutral Text
Make sure text is gender neutral wherever possible. Avoid the awkward “his or her” situation. 

E.g.:

  Instead of:  “A resident should take out his or her trash”  
  Write:  “Residents should take out their trash”

### Be Concise

To keep content understandable, concise and relevant, it should be:

 - informative
 - clear and concise
 - brisk (friendliness can lead to a lack of precision and unnecessary words), but not terse (remain human; don't sound like a machine)
 - serious but not pompous
 - still be a complete sentence

You should:

 - Use contractions (e.g., “can’t,” “here’s,” “you’ll”) – but avoid using “should’ve,” “could’ve,” “would’ve” – these are hard to read
 - Do not let caveats dictate unwieldy grammar – e.g.: write, “You can” rather than, “You may be able to”
 - use the language people are using – use Google Insights to check for terms people search for
 - Do not use long sentences with complicated sub-clauses

## POINTS OF STYLE

### Abbreviations and Acronyms

Spell out acronyms at first mention unless they’re well known (like the “FBI”).

In any article, the first time you use an abbreviation or acronym, explain it in full, and then refer to it by the acronym. E.g., “Department of Information Technology (DIT).” Don’t use an acronym if you’re not going to use it again later in the text.

### Punctuation

Use “and” rather than an “&” unless as part of a brand name.

In a list of items do not add a comma before the “and” or “or” that precedes the last item. E.g., “democracy, government and citizenship.”

Use (round brackets), not [square brackets]. The only acceptable use of square brackets is for explanatory notes in reported speech. 

E.g.

  > the Mayor said, “Thank you [Director] Bruce.”

Place quotation marks outside the period, comma, or bracket if the whole phrase is meant to be enclosed. But if only a part of the parenthetical text is quoted, the closing quotation mark should go inside. Also, for quotes within quotes, use single and double quotes to differentiate them. 

E.g.:

 > “Fill out the form first (but only after reaching the station).”
 
 > “Pay attention to popular terms (e.g., the verb 'register').”
 
Avoid using “/” to improve readability – where applicable, replace the slash with an “and” or “or.”

### Bullet Points

How to use bullet points to make text easier to read:

 - Always use a lead-in sentence
 - Bullets should always make sense running on from the lead-in sentence – whether the lead-in sentence is a title to the set of bullet points, or it forms a complete sentence when combined with each bullet point
 - Avoid using periods within bulleted lists – where possible, start another bullet or use commas, dashes, or semi-colons to expand on an item
 - If a bullet point must contain more than one sentence, you will have to apply periods to all the items in the bulleted list
 - There is no need to include an “or” or an “and” after the bullets
 - If the list is a series of steps that describes a process, present it as a numbered list
 - If the list contains content that is related but not a sequence of steps, use a bulleted list

### Capitalization

 - DON’T USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

 - The word “City” – as in “contact the City” or anywhere that City of Oakland could be substituted has a capital “C.”

 - Likewise, for job titles, specific departments, and other organizations, use initial capitals. 

E.g.

  > “Customer Service Department.”


### Numbers, Measurements, Dates, Times

Write all numbers in numerics (e.g., “the building has 5 floors”), except where it’s part of a common expression and would look strange (e.g., “One of them was always late to class”). Here’s an example showing the correct usage of both in the same sentence:

> “One should pause to think before climbing up 13 flights of stairs.”

If you have two unrelated numbers adjacent to each other, spell one of them to avoid confusion.  
  E.g.
  
  > - “Five 1-lb weights”
  > - “5 one-lb weights”
  
For numbers over 9999, insert a comma for clarity.  
E.g. 
 > “10,000.”

For phone numbers, spell out the word *“Phone:”* before the number, (unless it's a part of a sentence). Always include the area code and follow the closing bracket with a space.  
E.g.

> “Phone: (510) 444-CITY”  


Use a % sign for percentages.  
E.g.
 > “50%.”

When referring to money, don’t use decimals unless cents are included.  
E.g.

> use “$75.50” but not “$75.00.”

Write out “cents” in full.  
E.g.

> “Calls will cost 4 cents per minute from a landline.”  And instead of “$0.25,” say “25 cents.”

Spell out dates.

 > Instead of “6/1/13,” write “June 1, 2013.”

Time is written in the following format: 

 > “5:30 pm” without any dots in “pm.”

### Links and Email Addresses

Always offer links to online services first. Offer offline alternatives afterwards (where possible).

Make the link’s visible text as readable as possible:

If the reader doesn’t need to know the exact URL because it is not a website we need them to remember, use some descriptive text and link it to the website. 

E.g.

 > “Submit your proof of legal presence.”
 
If the exact URL is important to convey, write it as simply as possible. 

E.g.

 > “Honolulu.gov” without the “http://www1” part at the beginning.
 
Always link the text of a URL.

An email address should be written out in full and always linked.

### Hyphenation

In general, if in doubt, don’t use a hyphen unless the sense of the word is ambiguous without it.

For example, the following are non-hyphenated:

 - email
 - online
 - website
 - wifi
 - reuse
 - reopen
 - reorder
 
If “re” is followed by a word that starts with an “e” (e.g., “re-elect”), use a hyphen.
