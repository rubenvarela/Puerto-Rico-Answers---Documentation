ARTICLE TYPE:  WEB SERVICEWeb Services are tools and transactional pages that enable you to complete tasks online and interact with government.The format of a Web Service is very similar to that of a Quick Answer. The only difference is in the Top Section.In a Web Service, the Top Section always has a big call-to-action button that links to the online form or service where the user can complete the task she is looking to perform. This Top Section is automatically created, and all you need to do for this section is to provide the URL that the button should link to.The other sections are the same as for a Quick Answer.
